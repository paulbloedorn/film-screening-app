# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project involves transforming an existing Replit-based website into a comprehensive client-managed solution with content management capabilities, analytics tracking, and a client dashboard. The solution will integrate Tina.io for content management, deploy to Cloudflare Workers, implement dual analytics tracking (Cloudflare and Google Analytics), and provide a client dashboard for traffic monitoring and lead management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website owner, I want to integrate Tina.io CMS into my existing website, so that my clients can edit website content without technical knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client accesses the CMS interface THEN the system SHALL provide an intuitive content editing experience
2. WHEN content is modified through Tina.io THEN the system SHALL update the website content in real-time
3. WHEN the CMS is integrated THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing website functionality
4. IF a client makes content changes THEN the system SHALL preserve the website's design and layout integrity

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a website owner, I want to deploy my website to Cloudflare Workers, so that I can benefit from global CDN performance and scalability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the website is deployed to Cloudflare Workers THEN the system SHALL serve content from global edge locations
2. WHEN users access the website THEN the system SHALL maintain fast loading times across all geographic regions
3. WHEN the deployment is complete THEN the system SHALL handle both static assets and dynamic functionality
4. IF deployment issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and rollback capabilities

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a website owner, I want to integrate both Cloudflare Analytics and Google Analytics, so that I can have comprehensive traffic data and redundant analytics tracking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the website THEN the system SHALL track the visit in both Cloudflare Analytics and Google Analytics
2. WHEN analytics data is collected THEN the system SHALL capture page views, user sessions, geographic data, and referral sources
3. WHEN form submissions occur THEN the system SHALL track conversion events in both analytics platforms
4. IF one analytics service fails THEN the system SHALL continue tracking with the remaining service

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a client, I want access to a dashboard showing website traffic and lead management, so that I can monitor my website's performance and manage potential customers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display real-time website traffic metrics
2. WHEN leads are captured through website forms THEN the system SHALL store them in the Neon database
3. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL show lead information including contact details and submission timestamps
4. WHEN traffic data is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide visualizations for page views, unique visitors, and conversion rates
5. IF new leads are submitted THEN the system SHALL notify the client through the dashboard

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a website owner, I want to maintain the existing database integration with Neon, so that form submissions and user data are properly stored and managed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN forms are submitted THEN the system SHALL store data in the existing Neon database
2. WHEN database operations occur THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity and security
3. WHEN the CMS is integrated THEN the system SHALL preserve existing database schemas and relationships
4. IF database connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error handling and user feedback

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a website owner, I want secure authentication for the client dashboard, so that only authorized users can access analytics and lead data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clients attempt to access the dashboard THEN the system SHALL require proper authentication
2. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL provide role-based access to appropriate data
3. WHEN sessions expire THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication
4. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL deny access and log the attempt
